Cloudcity is a bash script that makes backing up a system to Cloud Files via Duplicity a bit easier.

Cloud Files is Rackspace's take on remote file storage and is similar to Amazon's S3. Learn
more here: http://www.rackspacecloud.com

Cloudcity depends on the following additional software:
python-cloudfiles-1.6.0 http://github.com/rackspace/python-cloudfiles
duplicity-0.5.18: http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/duplicity/duplicity-0.5.18.tar.gz
This program has not been tested with other versions of the above software.

You will need to modify the first part of the script, which is all configuration. At a minimum,
you must add your Cloud Files username and API key, as well as a GPG passphrase of your choice.

Usage:
  cloudcity [OPTIONS] [FILE]
Options:
  -a AGE  Specifies the age (in days) of the archived file or directory to be restored.
  -h      Displays this helpful information.
  -l      Lists all the files currently stored in the backup repository.
  -m      Automatically moves restored items to their original locations from the restore directory.
  -s      Displays the status of the backup chains and sets in the backup repository.
Examples:
  cloudcity
    Performs an incremental or full backup, depending on whether or not the latter is due.
  cloudcity /home/foo/
    Restores the /home/foo directory.
  cloudcity -ma2 /home/foo/bar.rb
    Restores bar.rb as it existed two days ago and moves it from the restore directory to /home/foo/.
